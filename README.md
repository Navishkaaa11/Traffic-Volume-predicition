# Traffic-volume-prediction


## 📌 Overview

Traffic congestion is a significant challenge in urban areas, impacting commute time, air quality, and overall productivity. This project focuses on predicting traffic volume using machine learning techniques by analyzing historical traffic data. The goal is to build predictive models that can help transportation departments and navigation systems make smarter decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict hourly or daily traffic volume using historical data.
- Explore correlations between traffic and external factors such as weather and time.
- Evaluate and compare various machine learning models.
- Visualize trends and patterns to understand traffic behaviors.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Dataset Name:** [Add dataset name, e.g., "Metro Interstate Traffic Volume"]
- **Source:** [Dataset link or origin]
- **Key Features:**
  - Date and time
  - Traffic volume count
  - Weather details (temperature, rain, snow, etc.)
  - Time-related features (hour, day, holiday, etc.)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Data Analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Modeling: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow` (if deep learning)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
